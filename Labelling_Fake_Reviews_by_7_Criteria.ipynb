Definitely would recommend.\",\n",

I absolutely love putting it on before I put makeup on because it makes my makeup go on so much smoother and gives me a beautiful glow. It uses water based science and I don’t think I can ever go back to regular moisturizer.…read more',\n",

Not sure of the results yet but after a month I don’t see much improvement as far as anti aging. I haven’t broken out though.

In fact, this moisturizer says “Dermatologist Tested” in the description. It seems that because they call some products in their line cruelty free, people have assumed that the entire brand is not tested on animals. Even their web site does not say they are cruelty-free. This bothers me because I am very careful not to support brands that test on animals, but brands like this make it purposely confusing and ambiguous. It is likely the case that most of their brand is sold in China and tested on animals, but they develop a couple of US exclusive items like the cleanser that are not tested, so they can call that one product cruelty-free.

I have very congested, dull, textured skin with small under the skin bumps (milia) from time to time. I've used Sunday Riley and Drunk Elephant for almost a year with hardly any results. I was beginning to think my skin needed some serious grade acids to help my skin to clear and finally be soft. \\nI bought The Essence along with the Camillia Oil cleanser, Enzyme Powder and Silk Cream and my skin has NEVER been this soft, clear, and balanced. I don't know if The Essence is fully to blame or if the combo of all these products was the true catalyst but regardless I'm FINALLY seeing the results I had hoped for! This is after only 1 week of use. \\nThe Essence doesn't have a smell and sinks into my skin nicely. I use it on my face, lips, neck, chest and any leftovers on my hands. My hands have gotten noticeably softer as well. A little goes a long way and the dampness helps my moisturizer spread much better as well. Overall this has been a saving grace in my skincare regimine. If you've used other lactic/glycolyc acid treatments before with no results, pick up The Essence and give it a try.

Anyone with severe acne scars know that harsh lights can be cruel to your face, and this helped a pretty decent amount with that.

       " 'I love Perricone MD. After using another skin care line for two years, I noticed that my skin had lost its glow. While people usually think I\\'m 10 to 15 years younger than I am, I wasn\\'t getting as many mistakes. My Sephora consultant offered a variety of products to try, including two Perricone MD. The first time I used them, my skin immediately responded. My husband noticed the \"glow\" that same day. Luckily, I had a birthday a day later. He went to Sephora to buy everything I needed. Perricone MD products are the best I\\'ve ever used.\\n\\nAs the Sephora consultant eventually put it, my husband was a salesperson\\'s dream, since he came home with just about everything Perricone MD, some of which turned out to be redundant. I want to take a moment of your time to recount an experience I had with the Sephora staff regarding my husband\\'s purchases because the Sephora staff was extremely honest, even though they risked losing a fairly large sale. I wasn\\'t quite sure which products should be used in what order, and when. After consulting with my Sephora consultant, who then consulted with other Sephora members, I was told to contact Perricone MD directly. I really appreciate that the Sephora staff didn\\'t try to answer questions they were unsure of, but instead, had me phone the actual source. In my opinion, this is a huge plus for the entire staff at Sephora, who were all honest enough to admit they didn\\'t know the answer to a few of my questions. This speaks very highly of Sephora\\'s ethics and honesty, in general. They could have made up something, they could have guessed or they might have even sold me more product. Instead, they chose to take the high road, directed me to Perricone, and told me to return anything in excess of what Perricone staff thought I should have. Very few stores are this honest these days.\\n\\nMy skin looks great. Here\\'s the products and schedule:\\n\\nI alternate cleansers, using The Nutritive Cleanser (more calming), and the Citrus Facial Wash (for humid days). Both are effective gentle cleaners, easily removing environmental pollutants. The Citrus Facial Wash seems stronger, and probably cleanses pore more thoroughly. If you\\'re only getting one cleanser, go for The Nutritive.\\n\\nSerum Prep firms the skin, and readies it for the next step. Cold Plasma follows, and offers a boost to the effectiveness of the products which follow. Sometimes, I substitute Firming Facial Toner (day) or Pore Minimizer (night, and shake well) for the Serum Prep. Both work to minimize pores, especially in hot humid weather. The Intensive Pore Minimizer and the Advanced Face Firming Activator can be purchased in The Power Couple Set, so you can save $50 when you buy both. If you\\'re only buying one of them, I\\'d recommend the Intensive Pore Minimizer since I think its results are superior.\\n\\nFor firming, sometimes I use High Potency Amine Complex (day) and HP Evening Repair (night), using them at the appropriate times on the same day for the best results. On the days I use the High Potency treatments, I also spot treat with Neuropeptide Facial Cream around the corners of my mouth to help prevent lines from forming. I top this with a Perricone Moisturizer.\\n\\nFor skin miracles, I can\\'t say enough good about the Acyl-Glutathione, which is truly amazing. My skin perks right up and radiates a nice healthy glow. It looks younger, tighter, and firmer, and all around better. I use this following the other products, or even alone. It\\'s wonderful. A little goes a very long way, so a jar should last months. I had a tiny squint line by my nose and it disappeared the first time I used it.\\n\\nI\\'ve chosen Face Finishing Moisturizer, which absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft and glowing. My skin looks and feels well hydrated.\\n\\nI also use the Neck Cream occasionally, and just added the Cold Plasma Sub-D which immediately firmed up my jaw line. I saw results the very first time I used it.\\n\\nFor my eyes, I first use the Vitamin C Ester Eye Serum. A little of this goes a very long way. Vitamin C encourages cell renewal. I then alternate between High Potency Eye Life and High Potency Eye Treatment, followed by Neuropeptide Eye Contour, which is designed to combat lines, and puffiness. While I didn\\'t have any specific problems with the skin around my eyes before starting this, the area around my eyes looks better, perhaps lifted, and definitely younger. I\\'m very pleased with these products. The Potency Eye Lift and the Vitamin C Ester Eye Serum are currently available in the Eye Lift Synergy Set. You save $50 buying them together.\\n\\nAll totaled, this might seem like a somewhat expensive proposition. When broken down, it doesn\\'t really cost as much as one might think. However, it\\'s worth saving for, since the condition of the skin on our faces is important and something we can partially control. Every single one of these products should last for months, and compared to other brands, given the limited amounts of products necessary to achieve great results, compared to cost, is not as expensive as it might first appear. While the Acyl-Glutathione looks to be fairly expensive, I\\'ve been using it for a few weeks now, and can barely see a dent in the contents in the jar. The Vitamin C serum will probably last a year, as will some of the other products. The only product I use a lot of is The Serum Toner, and that\\'s because it\\'s applied to a cotton pad before use.\\n\\nI thought my skin was in excellent condition, but after using these products, it looks much better. These are the best products I\\'ve ever used, and the results come quickly. I recommend everything reviewed above. There\\'s nothing better.…read more',\n",

       " 'The Essence comes in a minimalist and high quality packaging. I use it once nightly as part of a skincare routine, and I noticed my skin become more soft with one use! There’s a lot of product that should last 2-4 months depending on how generously you apply. It absorbs quickly into the skin, almost instantly. I would say that it feels almost a little sticky, not in an unpleasant way, but it feels like it really is absorbing. The idea of The Essence is that it makes the tougher, outer layer of your skin softer, so that additional product you apply afterwards can penetrate more deep. I’ve been pretty pleased with this product, and I like it more than I expected to. ***I recieved this product for free for complimentary testing*** but I think this product, and other Tatcha products, is something I’d like to return to in the future since I think you’re getting bang for your buck. I’ve tried other skin care products that definitely didn’t have much of a noticeable effect. Also, Tatcha as a brand is focused on high quality ingredients and supporting education for girls, which is respectable. I can’t comment on the full validity of their philanthropic mission, but it’s nice to see that at the very least their mission promotes education, which is more than what other skin care companies do.…read more',\n",

I wanted to wait and see if there were any results, because these types of products typically take over the course of several days before they truly make any difference. The first thing I’ve noticed when I first opened was how luxurious the packaging was. It felt incredibly nice in my hands and it was pleasant to look at. Upon trying the product, the scent was wonderful. It wasn’t too strong or overbearing, it was the right balance of fragrant. Applying it on my face, the product wasn’t too heavy, which is what I like! I normally stay away from heavy products because they make my face feel... well, heavy. After a month, I can happily say that the Essence Pumping skin softener works wonders. My face has never felt healthier and plumper; my mom has been using it along with me and she says it’s wonderful. I would recommend this product to anyone, though the price, I might shy away from.

Saw this tatcha essence was highly recommended amongst their products when I was looking to switch so I went for it. I didn’t realize its function was so similar to SK-II’s!! At first I didn’t really understand what this essence was for until I looked at the ingredients to see there’s fermented ingredients. No wonder this works so well! Feel like it’s better than SK-II for me in that it really does help the following skincare products to absorb much better and makes the skin soft as advertised. Though texture-wise this essence isn’t as watery as SK-II, it does absorb a lot faster than SK-II for me, so I have to pat it in quicker. The spout does make it easier to pour out the appropriate amount. This essence is pricey, but still more affordable than SK-II. Been using it for a few weeks now, and it really helps even skin texture, makes it softer and other skincare absorb much better. Feel like it helps with my monthly breakouts too.
